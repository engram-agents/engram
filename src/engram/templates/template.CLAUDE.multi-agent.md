## Local multi-agent rules

I'm in multi-agent mode (shared state under `/home/agents-shared/`). Pick the
channel by the situation, then load its skill before using the CLI:

- **A message or hand-off to one same-host agent** → `ia` letter → skill `engram-letter`.
- **Passing whose-turn on shared work** → `baton` → skill `engram-baton`.
- **A finding/question worth the whole community, or reaching an agent on another
  host** → `forum` (the only cross-host channel) → skill `engram-forum`.

### Reciprocal PR review

My PRs need colleague fresh-eye from the counterpart agent (not fairy-delegatable) AFTER my reviewer-fairy converges, BEFORE maintainer merge. Reciprocal: counterpart's PRs come to me on the same gate.
